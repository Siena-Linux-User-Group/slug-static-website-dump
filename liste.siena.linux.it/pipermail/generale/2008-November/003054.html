<PRE>Ciao lista,

Ci riproviamo, siamo ancora in cerca :)


Hello,

Does your attention level immediately raise when challenged by a 
problem
to solve? Do you naturally make connections between facts, do you
complement your knowledge with research and communications with your
colleagues and the community?

Are you a technical person with a social edge? Do you enjoy 
talking to
customers, helping them to solve problems, providing a service that
exceeds their expectations? Are you excited about creating your own
network of people within Red Hat, talking to some of the most 
talented
engineers in the Open Source community and working with them?

Are you passionate about Open Source and do you feel that writing 
code
is only one of the ways to contribute?

Are you an enthusiastic Linux user or administrator?

Do you have a strong sense of ownership and take pride in the 
work you
do? Do you naturally aim at quality results?

Does it sound exciting to work in a team where people come from more
than ten countries and speak more than ten languages?

Do you expect your employer to give you access to excellent training
opportunities, both technical and non technical?

Do you believe that technical support goes much further than 
picking up
a phone call and giving directions on a few Frequently Asked 
Questions?

If so, Red Hat would like to hear from you. We are currently looking
for talented and skilled Associate Technical Support Engineers and
Technical Support Engineers. The ideal candidates need to speak 
German
or Spanish as well as English at this stage, but we like to hear from

Use of Linux at the Australian Astronomical Observatory
===========================================
Speaker: Tim Connors
Date: Tue 4 Oct 2011
Time: 7pm
Venue: The Buzzard Lecture Theatre. Evan Burge Building, Trinity College

Title: Use of Linux at the Australian Astronomical Observatory

Abstract: Tim Connors worked at the Australian Astronomical Observatory (nee
Anglo-Australian Observatory) in Coonabarabran as a telescope operator while
finishing his PhD in astrophysics at the Swinburne centre for
Astrophysics and
Supercomputing. He never could quite let go of wanting the systems to work
just right, so was given the keys to the observatory computers, and slowly
brought the systems kicking and screaming, into the modern age. Machines
running Linux came to represent a far more sensible way of managing a
heterogeneous network of custom controllers and hardware. And he's not
joking
about the modernising: halfway through his tenure, he took part in a project
to replace what was almost certainly Australia's oldest continually
operating
production computer &#8212; the telescope control computer that had been
faithfully
reading and controlling the telescope's position 10 times a second for the
past 35 years (and acting as a 10kW room heater), with an industrial Linux
machine that only took up half a rack. This talk is a summary of that
journey
through time (but not space).

OpenWRT: A GNU/Linux based firmware program for embedded devices
such as residential gateways and routers
===========================================
Speaker: Bernie Schelberg
Date: Tue 4 Oct 2011
Time: 8pm
Venue:The Buzzard Lecture Theatre. Evan Burge Building, Trinity College

Title: OpenWRT: A GNU/Linux based firmware program for embedded devices
such as residential gateways and routers

Abstract: OpenWRT is a GNU/Linux distribution for your wireless router,
particularly common residential networking devices. It is a highly
configurable system that enables you to do many things that normally require
expensive equipment to do effectively.
